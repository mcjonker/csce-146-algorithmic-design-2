This repository contains my projects from my CSCE-146 Algorithmic Design II class.
- WordHelper is a progam backend that will scan a text document for certain attributes such as consonants, and vowels.
- VectorArbiter is a program that lets users compute with vectors. Vectors can be added, subtracted, and their magnitude can be calculated in the program.
- PrizeGame is a program that samples a random collection of items and their respective prices, then has the user guess their collective value, either winning or losing after one guess.
- DoubleDoubleLL is the backend for a doubly-linked list of the type double. It is the backbone for a type of foundational, expandable, non-array based data structure. The code can be changed from double to integers easily, however, changing to other data types requires more changes.
- DatabaseSearch is a basic data search program that allows the search of a selected text file (verified for .txt), and will return the lines that match the search query. Additional functionality includes the ability to send the search result to a output file of your choice (or create a new one), and the use of '*' as a wild card character, as one would use it in a Linux terminal. Current configuration only allows search in a database that has two elements, such as a book title and an author's name, where the two elements are separated by a tab.
