This repository contains my projects from my CSCE-146 Algorithmic Design II class.
- WordHelper is a progam backend that will scan a text document for certain attributes such as consonants, and vowels.
- VectorArbiter is a program that lets users compute with vectors. Vectors can be added, subtracted, and their magnitude can be calculated in the program.
- PrizeGame is a program that samples a random collection of items and their respective prices, then has the user guess their collective value, either winning or losing after one guess.
