This repository contains my projects from my CSCE-146 Algorithmic Design II class.
- WordHelper is a progam backend that will scan a text document for certain attributes such as consonants, and vowels.
- VectorArbiter is a progam that lets users compute with vectors. Vectors can be added, subtracted, and their magnitude can be calculated in the program.
